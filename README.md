## ðŸš€ General Usage Notes
This online book store application is console based. To start the program, download the Java files and use an operating system of your choice
that supports Java and connects to SQL to interact via text input (i.e IntelliJ IDEA Edu). 

## Design Decisions
This online book store was developed using JDBC. The program uses a relational data base to store data and access data. Intailly the databse is empty and can be filled with values once a connection is made when running the program. Either data can be inserted manually or an inserts.sql file is provided in this repository to insert data. The online book stores is functional with three classes. Classes "Customer" and "Manager" are the two interfaces for the BookStore system and the Class "BookStore" is considered the main interface of the bookstore because it is where the main method for the program is located and is the programs intial state.

Details on specfic functionalites of the system have been mentined in section 3 of the LookBookInna Project Report document that is provided in this repository. Overall, when your run the prgram, you will be given the option to wither sign in as an existing user or create a new account in the system. Once the system has identified whether you the user are a "Manager" or "Customer" you will be redirected to the corresponding interface and will be given through console output a list of specific user type functionalites that ou may orefrom in the online book store such as searching for a book as a customer and removing a book (from the database) as a manager.
