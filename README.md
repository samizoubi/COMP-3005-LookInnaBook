## ðŸš€ General Usage Notes
This online book store application is console based. To start the program, download the Java files and use an operating system of your choice
that supports Java and connects to SQL to interact via text input (i.e IntelliJ IDEA Edu). The team has provided an insertion.sql file to insert data into the database if you wish, or to give you a general layout of the insertions.

## Design Decisions
This online book store was developed using JDBC and Java.
